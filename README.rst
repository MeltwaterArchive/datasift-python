This is the official Python library for accessing DataSift APIs.

We have recently performed a major update to this library. The previous version is available `here <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/datasift/0.5.7>`_. That version will be supported until 4th September 2014.

Getting Started
---------------

**Read our** `Python Getting Started Guide <http://dev.datasift.com/quickstart/python>`_ **to get started with the DataSift platform.** This guide will take you through creating a `DataSift <http://datasift.com>`_ account, and activating data sources which you will need to do before using the DataSift API.

Many of the examples and API endpoints used in this library require you have enabled certain data sources before you can receive any data (you should do this at `datasift.com/source <https://datasift.com/source>`_). Certain API features, such as `Historics <http://datasift.com/platform/historics/>`_ and `Managed Sources <http://datasift.com/platform/datasources/>`_ will require you have signed up to a monthly subscription before you can access them.

If you are interested in using these features, or would like more information about DataSift, please `get in touch <http://datasift.com/contact-us/>`_!

Installation
------------

Install with ``pip``::

    pip install datasift

Install from source::

    git clone https://github.com/datasift/datasift-python.git
    cd datasift-python
    python setup.py install

Usage
-----

Full documentation is available at http://datasift.github.io/datasift-python


Supported Operating Environment
-------------------------------

This version of the client library has been tested, and is known to work against the following language versions and Operating Systems:

Language versions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Python 2.6
* Python 2.7
* Python 3.3
* Python 3.4
* pypy 2.7

Operating Systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Linux
* BSD
* OS X
* Windows 7/8

Style Guide
-----------

This code should conform to pep8, with the exception of E501, the 79 character line limit.

It can be style checked with the ``pep8`` module by running ``pep8 --show-source --ignore=E501 datasift/*.py``

Requirements
------------

Supports Python 2.6, 2.7 and 3.3, as well as pypy.
Uses ``requests``, ``autobahn``, ``six``, ``twisted``, ``pyopenssl`` and ``dateutil``.

On non-Windows systems, the ``twisted`` and ``pyopenssl`` packages require the Python and OpenSSL development headers before they can be installed. These are usually provided by distribution package managers in a separate package to the main packages.
